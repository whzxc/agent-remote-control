# Arc.TunnelNode

Real SRC/TUNNEL object adapter. Requires [Arc.Root](Root.md). Records use existing UI types; no stores, live reads or mutations are created by the mount. Privacy follows Root. All design-island content slots accept plain text only.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frame` | { layout: ArenaLayout } | Optional projected frame. The arena painter renders it with reduced motion; no Ingress association is inferred. |

## Mounting

Pass typed synthetic records from `Arc.fixtures` and stub callbacks through named `renderVals` holes. Use `Arc.fixtures.tunnelFrames` for TunnelNode. Missing optional facts are omitted or shown as unknown; historical references never acquire live state. Native editing, navigation and approval belong to the embedding host.
